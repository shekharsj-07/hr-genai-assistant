 Hello! How can I assist you today? If you have any questions or need clarification regarding our HR policies, feel free to ask. Here's a summary of the policies mentioned in your context:

1. EXIT INTERVIEW & FEEDBACK: All exiting employees are required to complete an exit survey and participate in a 1:1 interview with an HR Business Partner. Feedback is shared anonymously with relevant departments for organizational improvement.

2. PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT: Annual performance reviews occur in April and October, using a scale of 1 to 4. Promotions are considered during the April cycle.

3. CODE OF CONDUCT: Employees must comply with Acme’s code of ethics, treat colleagues with respect, avoid conflicts of interest, and not engage in workplace harassment or misconduct.

4. GRIEVANCE REDRESSAL: Concerns related to workplace behavior or policy violations can be submitted via the confidential grievance portal. Each case will be reviewed within 7 business days and an impartial HR representative will be assigned.

5. ATTENDANCE AND PUNCTUALITY: Employees are expected to maintain regular attendance and be punctual. Unscheduled leaves must be informed as early as possible to the reporting manager. Three consecutive days of unreported absence will be treated as job abandonment.
