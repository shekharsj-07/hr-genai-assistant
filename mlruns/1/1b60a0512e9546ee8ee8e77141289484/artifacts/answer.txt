 Based on the provided context, there are two types of reimbursements mentioned:

1. Expense claims: These can be submitted for various work-related expenses and are processed biweekly (Not specified if there's a limit to the number of claims per year).
2. Travel reimbursements: These are for travel-related expenses, such as accommodation, meals, and transportation, and require pre-approval from the reporting manager.

However, it is not specified in the policy if there's a limit to the number of travel reimbursements per year or if other types of reimbursements exist. Therefore, I would say that at least two types of reimbursements are possible.
